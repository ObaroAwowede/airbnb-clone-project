## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Implements API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.  
- **Database Administrator:** Designs schema, indexes, and optimizations.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling.  
- **QA Engineer:** Tests backend functionality and enforces quality standards.

## Technology Stack
- **Django** â€” Python web framework for the REST API.  
- **Django REST Framework** â€” API tools and serializers.  
- **PostgreSQL** â€” Relational database.  
- **GraphQL** â€” Optional flexible querying layer.  
- **Celery** â€” Asynchronous task processing (emails, background jobs).  
- **Redis** â€” Caching and broker for Celery.  
- **Docker** â€” Containerization for consistent dev/production environments.

## Database Design

### Users
| Field       | Type / Notes |
|-------------|--------------|
| id          | PK           |
| username    | unique       |
| email       | unique       |
| password    | hashed       |
| first_name  |              |
| last_name   |              |

### Properties
| Field         | Type / Notes |
|---------------|--------------|
| id            | PK           |
| property_name |              |
| listing_price | decimal      |
| owner_id      | FK â†’ users.id (many properties â†’ one owner) |

### Bookings
| Field      | Type / Notes |
|------------|--------------|
| id         | PK           |
| start_date | date         |
| end_date   | date         |
| user_id    | FK â†’ users.id (many bookings â†’ one user) |
| property_id| FK â†’ properties.id |

### Reviews
| Field          | Type / Notes |
|----------------|--------------|
| id             | PK           |
| title          |              |
| rating         | integer      |
| description    | text         |
| published_date | timestamp    |
| user_id        | FK â†’ users.id |
| property_id    | FK â†’ properties.id |

### Payments
| Field       | Type / Notes |
|-------------|--------------|
| id          | PK           |
| amount      | decimal      |
| user_id     | FK â†’ users.id |
| property_id | FK â†’ properties.id |
| booking_id  | FK â†’ bookings.id (one payment typically maps to one booking) |

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Registration, authentication, profile management.  
- **Property Management:** Create, update, list property listings.  
- **Booking System:** Reserve properties, view/manage bookings.  
- **Payment Processing:** Integrate third-party payments and record transactions.  
- **Review System:** Allow ratings and reviews for properties.  
- **Data Optimization:** Indexing and query optimizations for performance.

---

## API Security
Security is essential because the API handles personal data and payments. Key measures:

- **Authentication:** JWT (or OAuth2) for signed tokens on requests â€” prevents impersonation.  
- **Authorization:** Role- and resource-based checks (hosts vs. guests) â€” prevents data tampering.  
- **Rate limiting:** Throttle endpoints (per-IP / per-user) â€” mitigates brute force and abuse.  
- **Validation & sanitization:** Strict input validation to prevent SQLi/XSS and malformed data.  
- **Secure storage & transport:** Hash passwords (bcrypt/Argon2), enforce HTTPS â€” protects credentials in transit/storage.  
- **Payment security:** Use PCI-compliant providers (Stripe/PayPal); do not store raw card data.  
- **Logging & monitoring:** Audit logs and alerts for suspicious activity.

---

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD** automates testing and deployment.

- **CI:** Run tests and linters on push/PR.  
- **CD:** Deploy to staging/production after checks pass.

**Why it matters:** Faster, safer releases and fewer manual errors.

**Tools:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Heroku/AWS/Render, Postman/Newman for API tests.
