## The importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design

Identifying design properties is crucial because it enables us have a consistent theme. There will also be a smoother handoff from the design team to the developers as the layout is completely specified and the developer won't have to come up with font-styles, size etc for some components. It also aids communication and team work when the designers, programmers all follow the same design.

## UI Component Patterns

### Navbar
The Navbar is fixed at the top of all pages and contains the main navigation and quick-access buttons. Some of its features are:
- Branding & Logo: Usually positioned at the top-left, it takes users to the home page when clicked.
- Search Bar: Used to search for partiular items/places on the app.
- Navigation Links: Links or icons for notable sections. These collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- User Profile & Actions: Avatar or "Sign up / Log in" button on the top‑right; on log in, dropdown menu displays account settings, trips, and logout.
- Responsive Behavior: Adjusts layout (hides text, uses icons, changes spacing) to remain accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### Property Card
The Property Card is the modular preview module that is used on search results, category pages, or recommendations. It distills each listing into a brief, clickable tile. It includes elements:
- Hero Image/Image carousel: A cropped full‑sized photo (or mini‑carousel) of the property, you could hover or swipe reveals more photos.
- Title & Location: Brief title c and neighborhood or city name.
- Price & Rating: Nightly rate in bold, together with star rating and reviews.
- Property Details: Brief line of text or symbols for bedrooms/beds, bathrooms, and major amenities (Wi‑Fi, kitchen, etc.).
- Hover/Focus State: On desktop hover or mobile tap, the card may rise, show a "Wish List" heart, or show a short description.
- Accessibility Considerations: Alt text for images, text color contrast, and keyboard focus styles for interactive elements.

### Footer
This is fixed at the bottim of all pages and contains additional navigation, legal information and settings. It consists of:
- Company Links: About.
- Support & Legal: Help Center, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy.
- Language & Currency Selector: Drop-downs for selecting site language, currency, and region.
- Social & Branding: Small company logo or slogan with social-media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
